# Neighborhood Maps App
## Udacity FEND Project 7

This is the 7th project for the Front End NanoDegree by Udacity. It's a neighborhood map of coffee locations in St. Petersburg, FL. It is built using React along with Foursquare API. The user can search through the list off coffee shops by clicking on the markers or with the list view. Viewing each marker will give you the name and formatted address.

## Credits

Huge, huge, HUGE shoutout ro Ryan Waite, FEND project coach and mentor for his walkthrough that got the map loaded without using a react library, and his easy explanation of how to use the FourSquare API to get the markers to appear dynamically. Without his walkthrough, I would be floundering on how to get this all working until well past the deadline. Coffee on me whenever you want one, Ryan!
